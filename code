1. Look at interaction plots and discuss what you see. 

####Define Data
```{r}
#read data
PD <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#get subset of data that is complete for relevant variables
PD[,c("X", "ID", "Name", "Nationality", "Club", "PreferredFoot", "BodyType", "Position", "GKDiving", "GKHandling", "GKKicking", "GKPositioning", "GKReflexes"
)] <- list(NULL)


#isolate only complete cases
PD <- PD[complete.cases(PD),]

#need to fix a data issue
PD[,9] <- as.numeric(PD[,9])

names(PD)
```


#make an interaction plots
#this makes the plots
```{r}

as.factor(PD$InternationalReputation)
as.factor(PD$Age)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))

interaction.plot(PD$InternationalReputation,PD$Age,PD$Overall,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="International Reputation",main="Interaction Plot for Overall")
interaction.plot(PD$InternationalReputation,PD$Age,PD$Wage,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="International Reputation",main="Interaction Plot for Wage")
interaction.plot(PD$InternationalReputation,PD$Age,PD$Potential,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="International Reputation",main="Interaction Plot for Potential")
```

2. Run Two-Way MANOVA for these two categorical factors. Discuss your results, both univariate and multivariate.

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- manova(as.matrix(PD[,])~ PD$InternationalReputation + PD$Age + PD$InternationalReputation*PD$Age) 
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.aov(mod1)
```

#get multivariate results
```{r}
summary.manova(mod1)
summary.manova(mod1, test="Wilks")
```

3. Perform (multivariate) contrasts to compare levels of a particular factor or combinations of factors. Discuss your results **CONSIDER IT MAJOR EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU GET THIS TO WORK IN R**

4. If applicable, add a continuous variable to your model and fit as a multiple-response generalized linear model. Before you fit the model, make some plots to see if there are linear relationships between your covariates and your responses. 

#remove missing values
```{r}
PD2 <- PD[complete.cases(PD[,],)]
```

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(as.matrix(PD2[,])~ PD2$InternationalReputation + PD2$Age +  
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.lm(mod1)
```

5. Check model assumptions by making a chi-square quantile plot of the residuals. Modify your model as appropriate based on your findings.
```{r}

```
