1. Look at interaction plots and discuss what you see. 

####Define Data
```{r}
#read data
PD <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#isolate only complete cases
PD <- PD[complete.cases(PD),]

#choose only the data that will be useful and relevant for this MANOVA
data <- PD[,c("BodyType","PreferredFoot","BallControl","HeadingAccuracy","CM","ST","Overall")]

#there are a few players who, oddly, have their own names as their body type. we need to remove these players, and instead keep only the three body types below. subsetting and binding surely isn't the ideal way to do this, but i think it works fine.
data1 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Normal")
data2 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Stocky")
data3 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Lean")

newdata <- rbind(data1, data2, data3)
```


#make an interaction plots
#this makes the plots
```{r}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))

interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$Overall,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="Body Type",main="Interaction Plot for Overall")
interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$BallControl,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="Body Type",main="Interaction Plot for Ball Control")
interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$ST,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),xlab="Body Type",main="Interaction Plot for ST")
```

2. Run Two-Way MANOVA for these two categorical factors. Discuss your results, both univariate and multivariate.

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- manova(as.matrix(newdata[,3:7]) ~ newdata$BodyType + newdata$PreferredFoot + newdata$BodyType*newdata$PreferredFoot) 
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.aov(mod1)
```

#get multivariate results
```{r}
summary.manova(mod1)
summary.manova(mod1, test="Wilks")
```

3. Perform (multivariate) contrasts to compare levels of a particular factor or combinations of factors. Discuss your results **CONSIDER IT MAJOR EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU GET THIS TO WORK IN R**

4. If applicable, add a continuous variable to your model and fit as a multiple-response generalized linear model. Before you fit the model, make some plots to see if there are linear relationships between your covariates and your responses. 

#remove missing values
```{r}
PD2 <- PD[complete.cases(PD[,],)]
```

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(as.matrix(PD2[,])~ PD2$InternationalReputation + PD2$Age +  
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.lm(mod1)
```

5. Check model assumptions by making a chi-square quantile plot of the residuals. Modify your model as appropriate based on your findings.
```{r}

```
