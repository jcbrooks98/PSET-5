####Define Data
```{r}
#read data
PD <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#isolate only complete cases
PD <- PD[complete.cases(PD),]

#choose only the data that will be useful and relevant for this MANOVA
data <- PD[,c("BodyType","PreferredFoot","BallControl","HeadingAccuracy","CM","ST","Overall")]

#there are a few players who, oddly, have their own names as their body type. we need to remove these players, and instead keep only the three body types below. subsetting and binding surely isn't the ideal way to do this, but i think it works fine.
data1 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Normal")
data2 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Stocky")
data3 <- subset(data, BodyType == "Lean")

newdata <- rbind(data1, data2, data3)
```



####1. Look at interaction plots and discuss what you see. 

#make an interaction plots
```{r}

#par(mfrow=c(2,2))

interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$Overall,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),trace.label = "Preferred Foot",xlab="Body Type",ylab="Mean of Overall",main="Interaction Plot for Overall Rating", legend=FALSE)
legend("topleft", c("Left","Right"),bty="n",lty=c(2,1),lwd=3,col=c("red","blue"), title="Preferred Foot",inset = 0, cex=.8,y.intersp
=.7, horiz = TRUE)

interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$BallControl,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),trace.label="Preferred Foot",xlab="Body Type",ylab="Mean of Ball Control",main="Interaction Plot for Ball Control Rating",legend=FALSE)
legend("topleft", c("Left","Right"),bty="n",lty=c(2,1),lwd=3,col=c("red","blue"), title="Preferred Foot",inset = 0, cex=.8,y.intersp
=.7, horiz = TRUE)

interaction.plot(newdata$BodyType,newdata$PreferredFoot,newdata$ST,lwd=3,col=c("red","blue","black"),trace.label="Preferred Foot",xlab="Body Type",ylab="Mean of ST",main="Interaction Plot for Striking Skill",legend=FALSE)
legend("topleft", c("Left","Right"),bty="n",lty=c(2,1),lwd=3,col=c("red","blue"), title="Preferred Foot",inset = 0, cex=.8,y.intersp
=.7, horiz = TRUE)
```

*These interaction plots are very interesting.* 

*Firstly, we must be sure to address differences in the data. There are only 4000 left-footed observations, while there are 12116 right-footed players. Both are sizable samples, but the left-footed sample is nevertheless one-third as big. In a similar vein, 1004 players are listed as "Stocky", 5969 as "Lean", and the remaining 9143 as "Normal". Again, however, the group memberships are fairly large, and we remain comfortable using MANOVA in our analysis.*  

*None of the three plots is parallel. In all three, left and right footed players seem to be affected in differing amounts by changes in body type. Multivariate means for stocky left and right footed players seem particularly different. We hope to generate some significant findings with MANOVA.*  


####2. Run Two-Way MANOVA for these two categorical factors. Discuss your results, both univariate and multivariate.

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- manova(as.matrix(newdata[,3:7]) ~ newdata$BodyType + newdata$PreferredFoot + newdata$BodyType*newdata$PreferredFoot) 
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.aov(mod1)
```

#get multivariate results
```{r}
summary.manova(mod1)
summary.manova(mod1, test="Wilks")
```

3. Perform (multivariate) contrasts to compare levels of a particular factor or combinations of factors. Discuss your results **CONSIDER IT MAJOR EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU GET THIS TO WORK IN R**

4. If applicable, add a continuous variable to your model and fit as a multiple-response generalized linear model. Before you fit the model, make some plots to see if there are linear relationships between your covariates and your responses. 

#remove missing values
```{r}
PD2 <- PD[complete.cases(PD[,],)]
```

#fit linear model
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(as.matrix(PD2[,])~ PD2$InternationalReputation + PD2$Age +  
```

#get univariate results
```{r}
summary.lm(mod1)
```

5. Check model assumptions by making a chi-square quantile plot of the residuals. Modify your model as appropriate based on your findings.
```{r}

```
