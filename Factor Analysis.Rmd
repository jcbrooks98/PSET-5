```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#read data
PD <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#isolate only complete cases
PD <- PD[complete.cases(PD),]

#choose a subset of the data that 
data <- PD[,c(4,6,9,16,17,18,19,29,30,31)]
data[,5] <- as.numeric(data[,5])
```

1. Look through indicators (questions). Think about which indicators might be related through latent factors.

2. Compute the correlation matrix between all indicators (you may want to do this in batches). Comment on relationships you do/do not observe.
```{r}
data1 <- data[,1:length(data)]
cor(data1)
```
